# Notesss

The app is made using React JS and its dependencies. The app is named as Notesss as in this we can add notes which will be visible there and we can also delete them.
I have put the same code in Code Sandbox and providing the generated link here

One can also open the sandbox and look into the working code if they don't want to do npm install in their own computer.
